# Y2 2019 Summer: Web Development Challenge

Welcome to the webDev challenge! Please read all the instructions so you don't
get lost halfway through, but definitely feel free to ask for help if you
get stuck. Good luck, and have fun!

### Setup

Before you start coding, make sure you fork and clone the repository
for this lab:
```
cd ~/Desktop
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/y2s19-webDevChallenge.git
```

## Instructions
Working in teams of 4, your mission is to complete as many of these challenges as possible in one hour. Some challenges are easier or harder, but they all count for 1 point. It might be a good idea to read through the list first and then decide how to split them up. For each challenge, you need to create an example (you can have separate examples for separate challenges) and then at the end, the instructors will judge the examples and award points.

Your team starts with 5 tokens. You can turn in a token to receive at most 5 minutes of help from an instructor (use the help queue to ask for help). *This is all the help you can get, so use your tokens wisely.*
